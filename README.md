## PepAln: Simple Peptide Alignment Visualization

This Python package is designed match short peptide sequences detected via Mass Spectroscopy to a FASTA file then produce alignment outputs in various formats. An input file format would be:

    Peptide     F145I/Dd2Dd2    Mass_Spec_Mode
    VG;GV          3.493           POS
    PA             2.454           POS
    SP             4.701           NEG

## Installation

    pip install pepaln

## Usage

	python -m pepaln -m fragments.txt -r reference.fa

Generates the files called `output.gff`, `output.txt` and `output.pdf`

## What does this package do?

A collaborator asked me to align short peptides from a Mass Spec experiment to a sequence, then show him an image that displays in an easy-to-see format where does each peptide align and which regions are not covered.

For example, when they had a series of short fragments like:

    VL LS LSP LSPAD PA NVKAA NVK VKA AA
    
And an origin sequence of:

    VLSPADKTNVKAAWGK

They wanted to see it matched in a way that lets them see which region is well covered and which region is not covered. I came up with the following visualization that also displays individual, non-overlapping alignments with a packing heuristic:

    VLSPADKTNVKAAWG
          **      
    VL PA   NVKAA  
     LS     NVK    
     LSP     VKA     
     LSPAD     AA     
     
The `*` above indicates a region that is not covered. In addition they wanted to display different peptides with colors as well.

I was unable to locate a tool that has a similar functionality, hence I wrote this package.

## Input data

The input consists of a tab delimited format with at least three columns:

    Peptide     F145I/Dd2Dd2    Mass_Spec_Mode
    VG;GV          3.493           POS
    PA             2.454           POS
    SP             4.701           NEG

Where:

1. The first column lists the peptide sequence (multiple sequences may be separated with a semicolon `;`).
2. The second column lists a value 
3. The third column indicates the ionization mode

The reference fasta file may contain more than one target sequence.

A separate visualization will be generated for each reference sequence.

## Outputs

The tool will generate outputs in three formats TXT, GFF as well as PDF formats. The default filenames are

* `output.txt`, `output.gff`, `output.pdf`

You may override each.
